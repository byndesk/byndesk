## Byndesk- A form builder integrated with Square Appointments to streamline client intake and eliminate the back-&-forth

<!--
We didn’t start out trying to build a form tool — we were trying to stop people from forgetting to fill them out.

Byndesk began with a simple but critical problem: clients kept showing up to appointments without having filled out their intake forms or signed the required waivers. Businesses are constantly chasing people with email reminders or scrambling to get paperwork signed in-person — wasting 15–20 minutes per appointment and creating friction right when they should’ve been focused on service.

We talked to dozens of small businesses that use Square Appointments — salons, massage therapists, wellness studios — and every single one had the same pain point. Some even started blocking out extra time in their schedule just in case a client arrived unprepared.

That’s when it hit us: what if forms were part of the booking flow itself?

We built Byndesk to do exactly that — to give businesses a way to embed intake and consent forms directly into the booking flow of Square Appointments, making them mandatory before a client can confirm their booking.

No more reminders. No more delays. No more liability risk. Just one seamless, professional experience for everyone.

Byndesk exists so service businesses never have to say for the fifth time, “Did you fill out the form?” ever again.
